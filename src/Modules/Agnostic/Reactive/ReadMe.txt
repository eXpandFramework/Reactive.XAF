Project Description

This project implements a platform-agnostic Module. UI-independent application 
elements can be implemented here (Business Objects, Controllers, etc.). The root 
project folder contains the Module.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits 
ModuleBase. This class can be designed with the Module Designer that allows 
you to view and customize Module components: referenced modules, Controllers 
and business classes. Additionally, the root folder contains Application Model 
difference files (XAFML files) that keep application settings specific for the 
current Module. Differences files can be designed with the Model Editor.
