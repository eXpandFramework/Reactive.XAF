# About
In the `Packages` repo you can find low dependency DevExpress XAF modules distributed as nugets.

There are two namespaces in the source, follow the links to read more. 
1. The [DevExpress.XAF.Extensions](https://github.com/eXpandFramework/Packages/blob/master/src/Extensions/)
1. The [DevExpress.XAF.Modules](https://github.com/eXpandFramework/Packages/tree/master/src/Modules)

All `Modules`-`Extensions` ditributed only as nuget packages. We aim for low dpendency XAF modules so expect to see only a small set of classes per project. To get help for each module navigate to its root `Readme` file.
